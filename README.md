# Sorting Is A Joke: Useless Sorting Algorithms
## Slow Sort: Multiply and Fucking Give Up
 1. Recursively calling the sorting function for the max of N/2 elements
 2. Recursively call the function for the max of the remaining N/2 elements
 3. Find largest of the two and store it at the end
 4. Recursively call the function again for the entire array except the max

Fucking stupid.
